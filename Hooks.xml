      [H4]The New Recruit[h4]
      Under the guidance of such wise administrators as
Mon Mothma, the Alliance began recruiting efforts
very early in its inception. Those skilled in the ways
of intelligence, oration, and sheer talent scouting were
employed from the start to build growing networks
dedicated to finding those who had cause to oppose
the Empire as well as the capability and the will to take
action against it. As the conflict grows, so, too, does
this network dedicated to finding bodies to fill the
ranks and serve the needs of the Alliance.
A Player Character may well be a part of the Rebellion
because he was discovered by someone in this
network—someone who saw his potential and recognized
his willingness to fight against the current regime
imposed by Emperor Palpatine. It might not even have
been someone normally tasked with recruitment who
found the PC; chance encounters by those connected
to the Alliance with those who might be able to help
occur all the time, and risks are frequently taken if it
means an opportunity to gain the services of a capable
and savvy ally.
The cellular nature of most Alliance operations minimizes
the risk of betrayal fairly well. Such recruits are
tested considerably before they are ever given access
to sensitive material or plans, and their awareness of
the extent of the network they are connected to is kept
to a minimum until they have truly earned the trust of
their superiors.

      [H4]The Searching Insurgent[h4]
      Once they make the decision to oppose the terror and
atrocities of the Empire, many individuals go looking
for a way to contact and join up with the Rebellion. As
badly as the Alliance needs people, though, it's not necessarily
easy to find Alliance members to talk to about
signing on. The vastly superior forces and assets of the
Empire make it very dangerous for anyone to openly
support the Alliance, as many planets and people discovered
in the immediate aftermath of the Declaration
of Rebellion. Imperial Intelligence and related agencies—
not to mention countless bounty hunters—are
constantly searching for any and all beings connected
to the Rebellion, so secrecy is paramount to survival.
As such, finding a way to join the Alliance's efforts
against the Empire can be a quest all its own. It could
even be the basis for the start of an ACE OF REBELLION
campaign. Hopefuls need to do a lot of research, investigation,
and sneaking around to discover clues about
the Rebellion and to avoid the attention of Imperial
agents. At the same time, they must prove themselves
capable and trustworthy to anyone with whom
they might make contact. Such an endeavor is a very
tense, very delicate game of cat and mouse at first;
the searchers might even fall under Alliance observation
for a time, not knowing they are being observed
and judged while they continue to try to find a way in.
Many who want to join the Rebellion do so in rather
dramatic fashion, taking it upon themselves to simply
start striking against Imperial forces and assets. Such
acts can be foolhardy and stupid, but they can also
be brave and daring. If the would-be Rebels manage
to succeed without getting themselves killed in the
process, they may well draw the attention of Alliance
operatives who are willing to talk to them about joining.

      [H4]The Accidental Rebel[h4]
      The vast majority of the sentient beings of the galaxy
have no desire to join the Alliance or serve in the
Rebellion. They may not be ardent supporters of the
Empire, but this doesn't mean they are willing to drop
everything in their lives to go blasting away at hordes
of stormtroopers or weaving a dilapidated starship
through swarms of TIE fighters. They would rather go
about their business and live their lives, hopefully out
of the way of any battles or other trouble.
Unfortunately for some hapless individuals, the galaxy
has other plans. Cases of mistaken identity can
result in innocents becoming wanted for crimes they
never even considered. Receiving goods marked for Alliance
use may find one or more PCs fleeing for their lives
from Imperial agents or hired mercenaries. A friend's—
or even casual acquaintance's—involvement with the
Rebellion can saddle a character with unintended guilt
by association. Of course, there are times when people
simply find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong
time and have no choice but to become heroes.
Alternately, unexpected situations may cause an
epiphany for someone who was previously not interested
in getting involved. While it may be easy to
ignore tales of injustice and atrocity when they happen
far away from an individual's daily life, many individuals
have altogether different reactions when they come
face-to-face with the horror of the Empire's policies.
Apathy is difficult to maintain when someone watches
another sentient executed for speaking out, a family
enslaved because of their species, or an entire population
wiped out for political expediency.
In such situations, a person's apathy can quickly turn
to anger. That anger, in turn, often turns to action, usually
with violent and irrevocable consequences. Once
steps are taken toward open and direct opposition,
such a character has joined the Rebellion in spirit, even
if not yet in fact.
