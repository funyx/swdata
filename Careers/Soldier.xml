    Soldiers are the ones who take up arms and
face death for a cause, for pay, or sometimes for
lack of anything better to do. Fighting is what
they know and what they do, and the ones
who do it best survive long enough to pass
on that knowledge to the green recruits
who follow in their bloody footsteps.
There is glory and honor to be
found serving as a Soldier, yet
there is also terror, pain, blood,
and brutality. For a Soldier, a
boring day is often one of his
best days.
Administrators and politicians
craft policy, commanders
dictate how policy is to
be implemented, and Soldiers
are the tools of that
implementation. Most
care little for what
the actual policy is;
for them, the job is to
take out the enemy
and stay alive (not
necessarily in that
order). Some
S o l d i e r s
are more
invested in
the causes they are fighting
for, motivated by
the knowledge that
they fight for something
worthy.
On the battlefront,
behind enemy
ines, and across the
galaxy, the true heart
and soul of the Rebelion
is found in the Soldiers
who serve beneath
its banner. The causes they fight for are
justice and freedom from tyranny. The
cost of failure is almost certainly death, not only for
themselves, but for everyone and everything they love.
