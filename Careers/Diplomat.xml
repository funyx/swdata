    [H4]Diplomat[h4]
    The single most important resource in
any war is people, and the Diplomat is
the procurer of this resource, as well as
the one who guides its use. Diplomats
may not directly wage the war, but
they ensure there is a chance for victory,
and they are utterly indispensable
for arranging and managing the
peace to follow.
While many of the Rebellion's
heroes wage war with weapons,
Diplomats are masters of employng
words for strategic gain. If the
stylus is stronger than the sword,
then it is the Diplomat who must
wield it with the skill and finesse
necessary to achieve victory
without spilling a drop of blood.
Whether overseeing a treaty with
a potential ally or arranging the
terms for an enemy's equitable
surrender, a Diplomat's battleheld
is the negotiating table.
In the halls of the Senate,
on the streets of a planet rife
with political discord, or in a
warehouse full of desperately
needed medical supplies, the
Diplomat struggles to gain
the upper hand and achieve
a favorable—and perhaps
peaceful—outcome for his
people. No matter his methods,
the Diplomat's success
or failure has dramatic impact on
a great many lives, and this drives
him to passionately pursue his own
form of victory at all costs.
