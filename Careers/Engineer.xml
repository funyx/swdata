    [H4]Engineer[h4]
    There would be no Galactic Civil War
if not for the massive technological
capabilities of
both the Empire and the
Alliance. Machines of every
size and weapons of every
type are employed across
great distances to hammer
away at the enemy.
These machines are
imagined, designed,
and built by Engineers,
and Engineers are the
ones who know how to
keep them running—or
to stop them cold.
Engineers speak the
languages of computers,
engines, and electrical
conduits (they should,
since they invented them).
Most engineers prefer working
with technology over people,
especially in light of how
chaotic the latter are. While
some Engineers are fully (and
eagerly) aware of the massive
destruction their creations
are capable of, most are
merely fascinated with the
challenge of creating something
new, or fixing something
thought beyond repair. Some
focus their attentions on disrupting
the machines of others, pitting
their knowledge and talents
against those of rivals working for
the opposition.
Whether at the design table,
n the hangar bay, or scurrying
towards an access panel with
explosives in hand, Engineers
are a vital part of the Alliance's
war effort. They bring the Rebellion new weapons to
fight with, keep its machines in service, and deliver devastating
setbacks to the Empire's continuing agenda to
craft superweapons of mass destruction.
