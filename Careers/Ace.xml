    [H4]Ace [h4]
    Piloting vehicles, from repulsorlift speeders
to massive starships and everything in
between, is a fairly common skill for anyone
who lives outside of a completely isolated,
low-tech society. However, when it's
time to get somewhere fast or plunge into
the thick of vehicular combat, Aces are the
ones people want at the controls.
Just getting from one place to another is
not enough for the Ace; this flier wants to
get there faster, and to do so with style.
He'd rather dive headlong into an asteroid
field with half a dozen ships on his
tail than safely move cargo down a
well-traveled hyperspace lane. Aces
are not the kind of people most
transport companies want to hire to
move their goods. They are, however,
in very high demand when it
comes to ship-to-ship combat of
any kind, or when war machines
need to be maneuvered into place
during a planet-side battle.
The Ace isn't just a master of
piloting and driving, but often has a gift
for using vehicular weapons to deadly effect.
He understands that shooting is about more
than merely looking through a scope and pulling
a trigger—leading the target, compensating
for the complexities of moving bodies in space,
and aiming for vulnerable systems make the
Ace a force to be reckoned with in any
dogfight or speeder chase.
