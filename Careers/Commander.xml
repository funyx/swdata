    [H4]Commander [h4]
    Individual warriors can act
bravely and with resolute
determination, accomplishing
great things. They
can also cause untold havoc
without any real achievement,
save property damage
and loss of life, including their
own. A motley mob of people
capable of violence is only a threat
until a more disciplined force arrives
to put it down.
The role of a Commander is to
organize, manage, and lead the
fighters and other people who
serve in a military force so they
accomplish truly great things
together. He must see the bigger
picture, make the hard
decisions, and motivate his
people to charge into the jaws
of death for a greater cause,
all while never wasting personnel
or resources. Without good
Commanders, true victory is
mpossible for any military.
Whether on the bridge of a
capital ship, flying in formation
with a squad of starfighters,
or standing on a hill shouting
encouragement to his troops,
the Commander is the true
heart and soul of the Alliance
military. In his hands lies the
key to victory or defeat.
