    [H4]Spy[h4]
    Soldiers of a different type, Spies seek out the
secrets of the enemy, undo the enemy's plans,
and hinder the enemy's ability to do battle
effectively. A single Spy, in the right place
at the right moment, can save (or destroy)
many thousands of lives, with a single welltimed
action. Most military forces
(along with governments, criminal
factions, and large corporations)
place a great deal of emphasis on
crafting an effective corps of espionage
operatives.
The primary role of any Spy is the
gathering of intelligence—information
about what is happening in the areas
of operation, as well as what
the enemy is doing—for those
in command of Allied forces.
There are many ways to do
this, meaning there are many
types of Spies with divergent
specialties. Some focus on infiltrating
the ranks of the enemy
and gathering data from within,
while others focus on external
observations of troop and asset
movements. Some take advantage
of the dependency of modern
military forces on electronic means of data collation,
tapping into their opponents' networks and
siphoning off everything that can be snagged.
The Alliance's reliance on Spies cannot be
understated. Together with other specialist
operatives, Spies are critical to the Rebellion's
chance for success. Their skills and talents play
a crucial role in balancing the scales against the
Empire's overwhelming superiority in both forces
and resources. As the war progresses, however,
the Alliance can no longer treat its Spies as
untouchable assets, never to be unduly risked;
more and more, Spies are being called on to
make direct strikes against the targets from
which they are sent to gain information.
